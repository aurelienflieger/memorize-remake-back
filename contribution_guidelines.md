# GIT FLOW

## 1. Work on a new branch

- when introducing a new feature, create a new **feature branch** : `feature/[featureName]`
- when fixing a bug, create a new **bugfix branch** : `bugfix/[bugName]`
- when experimenting with a feature you may not implement, create a new **experimentation branch** : `experimentation/[experimentation]`

## 2. Push the repository

As you finish working on a specific branch, commit & push the branch to the distant repository.

## 3. Make a pull request

Then create a _pull request (PR)_ for merging it to the `dev` branch.

### Naming conventions

- Always start with the keyword then separate your description with a `/` : `[keyword]/[description]`
- Use `_` to separate distinct words or word groups
- Use `-` to separate two words belonging to one word group
- Use only lowercase
